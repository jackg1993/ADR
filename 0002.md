# 1. Record architecture decisions

Date: 2023-10-17

## Status

Proposed

## Context

I am deciding on a particular technology stack to use for my project.

## Decision

I have decided to use c#, SQL and Blazor.

## Consequences

I have decided to use these technologies as I am already very familiar with c# and although I have never used Blazor its something
I want to learn. This could cause issues as I would be learning a new technology to use whilst building the project. It is also
the best option for a front end against c#.
