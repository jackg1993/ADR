# 1. Record architecture decisions

Date: 01/12/2023

## Status

Proposed

## Context

I decided to change the users on my application as it made more logical sense.

## Decision

I got rid of "dependant visa applicant" and changed some of the other roles because it made more sense to me.

## Consequences

I think I have a much clearer view on what I need to do and it makes it far clearer on what exactly i'm trying to achieve.
